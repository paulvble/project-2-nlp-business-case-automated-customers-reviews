After discarding and getting rid of broken cd cases, broken cds, and selecting those ones we really like, this binder turned up to be an excellent option to store our favourite cds and dvds and keep them in a small space at our living room, giving us the choice to donate or get rid of those cds towers that took a lot of room, despite looking nice. And because you can turn the pages, you can spot the cd you want to play without the hassle of taking it from a case that is falling apart. After storing them cds, all the cases and printed covers went straight to the recycling centre. We have a small version to put those cds my husband would like to listen to whenever he must drive away for work. A few dollars more, but I am boycotting amazon Pros: Standard Echo.

After discarding and getting rid of broken cd cases, broken cds, and selecting those ones we really like, this binder turned up to be an excellent option to store our favourite cds and dvds and keep them in a small space at our living room, giving us the choice to donate or get rid of those cds towers that took a lot of room, despite looking nice. And because you can turn the pages, you can spot the cd you want to play without the hassle of taking it from a case that is falling apart. After storing them cds, all the cases and printed covers went straight to the recycling centre. We have a small version to put those cds my husband would like to listen to whenever he must drive away for work. A few dollars more, but I am boycotting amazon Pros: Standard Echo. Cons: Older generation Echo. Other Thoughts: Arrived on time and was new in box. Pros: Got it for under 50, much impressive sound than 2nd gen. H...\n",

After discarding and getting rid of broken cd cases, broken cds, and selecting those ones we really like, this binder turned up to be an excellent option to store our favourite cds and dvds and keep them in a small space at our living room, giving us the choice to donate or get rid of those cds towers that took a lot of room, despite looking nice. And because you can turn the pages, you can spot the cd you want to play without the hassle of taking it from a case that is falling apart. After storing them cds, all the cases and printed covers went straight to the recycling centre. We have a small version to put those cds my husband would like to listen to whenever he must drive away for work. A few dollars more, but I am boycotting amazon Pros: Standard Echo. Cons: Older generation Echo. Other Thoughts: Arrived on time and was new in box. Pros: Got it for under 50, much impressive sound than 2nd gen. H...\n",

      "Original Reviews: My initial impression of this was very good. The material is nicer than the shiny stuff on my Hama CD binders and the netting trim gives a nice appearance compared to plain look of most budget CD binders.There are 50 pages with 8 disc pockets each (4 per side) giving a total of 400 capacity. The pages are hung from the spine in two groups of 25. By that I mean that 25 pages all have a single attachment point to the plastic spine.This is where the first problem with this binder lies. Because each group of 25 pages shares the same anchor point in the spine, the pages cannot sit flat once full of discs. They bend and arch, and apart from looking tatty this puts a lot of tension across the plastic film. With long-term usage I suspect this plastic film will will tear due to the tension. It also makes it awkward to browse the binder as the pages don't sit flat. It may even crack or bend your discs.I look to my Hama 120 binder to see how it *should* be done - it only has 30 pages and yet they...\n",

      "Original Reviews: If you're looking for something to keep your laptop cool, this will do the trick. Although only bad things are, it isn't comfortable sitting on your lap as the metal just isn't awesome. The rivets where you rest your hands are welded things and they're uncomfortable as they dig into your hands when trying to type or even resting your hands. Wouldn't recommend.. Too small for 17 he envy very tight fit. Otherwise great product Too many zippers IMO. Good quality, but the zippers frequently get caught making it slightly annoying to open. This bag does not fit my 17-inch laptop, although mine is a little bigger than many. You would need a relatively thin 17-inch laptop to make this work. Also, as some other reviewers described, it has a cheap-feeling inner lining. I also do not like that the zippers for the main pocket do not extend toward the base farther, so this does not open as wide as I would like.

      "Original Reviews: ASIDE FROM THE FACT THAT THE SCREEN IS SMALL, IT'S A GREAT LITTLE DEVICE. FOR THOSE THAT PREFER A LARGER SCREEN, THE ECHO SHOW WOULD BE A BETTER CHOICE. Simple in its design, with multiple angles, the mesh keeps your laptop cool, the cord keeper in back keeps organized, and the surface area is great for a 15.6 laptop. I think this would also work for a 17 laptop, but there may be a larger model for those. Check first. The only gripe I have about this unit is the two 'tabs' that keep the laptop from sliding down into your lap when adjusted up at an angle. These two tabs could benefit from being 1/2 taller than they are. This would allow a 'thicker' laptop base from 'spillage' like my Toshiba seems to occasionally do. So that is my only con for this item. I would still suggest buying it. Every other laptop cooler I have purchased has a USB plug to run a fan. Got tired of the fans making noise, the USB or cooler plug not working eventually etc.So gave this one a shot and it does what it s...\n",

Decent speaker with nice amazon prime/Alexa features Good for light to medium usage, but not great for reading or watching movies. Good for movies and movies, not for reading. Good for the price but not the quality that went into previous Fire HD versions. Good for basic use, not great for gaming. Good for kids, not so great for adults. Not worth the hassle of getting it set up and working with it out of the box. Kindle Fire HD 8 needs a step by step guide on how to get the most use out of this tablet for the most part. Good tablet for the price, but not great for what I need it for. Not as useful as I'd like. Not user friendly or intuitive. Good tablet for the price, but not great for a lot of games and games for kids, not a great tablet for adults. Good for kids tablet, not great for adults, but good for the price. Good for the purpose for which it was bought. Worth the price for what it is and the price it was - but not what I was looking for. Good for kids and the elderly Good for the price, but not for everyone who uses Kindle and Amazon. Get what you pay for, get it on a sale! Good for shopping and fun, not for work or productivity. Fire HD 8 16 GB (2017) is a decent tablet for a $100 price point Good tablet for beginners, not so good for Android lovers. Too much Amazon advertising ad nauseum. Bad screen quality. Not worth the price. It's ok for the price, not great for kids or those who like to read, but it's okay for a basic tablet. Good kids tablet for the price, not great for adults. Not as good as I thought, not as easy to use as I expected. Not as good as I thought it would be, but for the price it's a good tablet for the money. Not a substitute for an iPad. Decent tablet for the price, but not the best for kids over 10 years old. Not a fan of the Amazon type operating system. Good starter tablet for kids, but slow and hard to set up for a true Pad savy child. Good for kids and games. Good for kids, but not kid friendly at all. Not as user friendly as described and slow performance and charging port is terrible. You pay for what you get, but you get what you pay for. Good starter tablet for kids, but not for adults. Good for kids and games, not as many free apps as expected, but still great for the price. Good for the kids and easy to use. Not a good fit for kids, not as user friendly as described, slow performance and low quality charging port, no Google Play Store. Good for the price, but not great for movies and videos. Good for reading, not so good for movies. Amazon Fire HD8 is horrible. Good tablet for the price but not as good as I thought it was going to be. Not worth the hassle of trying to set it up. Lags and freezes every so often. No instructions on how to use it. Good starter unit. Easy for a beginner to use. The specs are good, feels solid, can't stand the OS. If that...\n",
