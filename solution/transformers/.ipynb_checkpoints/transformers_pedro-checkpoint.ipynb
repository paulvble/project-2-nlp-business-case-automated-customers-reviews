      "Great case to keep everything in its place! My husband love it!!!! Holds a lot of cds! After discarding and getting rid of broken cd cases, broken cds, and selecting those ones we really like, this binder turned up to be an excellent option to store our favourite cds and dvds and keep them in a small space at our living room, giving us the choice to donate or get rid of those cds towers that took a lot of room, despite looking nice. And because you can turn the pages, you can spot the cd you want to play without the hassle of taking it from a case that is falling apart. After storing them cds, all the cases and printed covers went straight to the recycling centre. We have a small version to put those cds my husband would like to listen to whenever he must drive away for work. A few dollars more, but I am boycotting amazon Pros: Standard Echo. Cons: Older generation Echo. Other Thoughts: Arrived on time and was new in box. Pros: Got it for under 50, much impressive sound than 2nd gen. Has every other functionality. Cons: May be not trendy looking as newer, but still sets well on my kitchen island Pros: I love the Alexa series so when this one went on sale I had to get it with a camera. Now I can watch my security cameras from my couch or even drop in and see whats going on in other places. The audio is nice and loud and the picture is clear Cons: I wish I could stop the screen from turning off I keep thinking its unplugged but its saving power I guess I wasn't sure I even wanted this item, but caught up in all the excitement surrounding the Alexa enabled devices. Well....after getting it home I became addicted and ordered two Echos for the entertainment stand and today I have to Sub coming. I can't say enough for the product as well as the quick service/pick up at the Target store. Great service and product! Pros: Works good like Alexia Cons: setting it up is a , HASLE had to call verizon three times Other Thoughts: I WOULD RECOMMEND IT Pros: Relatively easy to setup and works quite reliably. Cons: The mirror cast function didn't seem to work well displaying video while it was steaming to a Windows 10 laptop. Other Thoughts: This product was recommended to me by a coworker and I was skeptical at first, but the product has turned out to be what I now rely on for most of my entertainment access. Pros: I WOULD recommend anyone who was going to purchase anything , newegg is the BEST PLACE TO LOOK ! Cons: No compaints Pros: Allows you to cut your cable. With many apps to download and many apps that allow you free use of services such as streaming as long as you have a Cable provided (at least for the internet), you can log in and stream. You can use apps like Kodi and TubiTV to watch many shows. My favorite is TubiTV. Yes, there are commercials but not as many as other services.Buy this, check it out, enjoy your freedom from cable TV! Cons: Don't really have any complaints. Pros: I'm a subscriber to DirectTV Now! So i pay a yearly discount and get over 450+ channels streamed to my TV for 59 a month, I pay for Prime/Netflix. combined, My cable bill was 172.00 I get more choices options, and I got the components to run it off ethernet, so no lag.I have un-metered fiber optic, so I can stream a lot, given how my family is good at leaving it running. Cons: TV's in which HDMI ports don't extend out make this difficult to install, My 4K TV has side ports took me like 4 minutes. Wireless is pointless and get the ethernet addon Pros: Very satisfied I am about buy online this side wonderful service good Quality seal pack and good packing Cons: Great Other Thoughts: I am satisfied thanks With an Income Tax Preparation practice I'm on my laptop 10 hours a day entering data. Using the laptop keyboard and mouse pad on the flat and level angle that laptops offer is stressful. An elevated keyboard serves the purpose of 'tilting' the keyboard into a natural position for typing. This AmazonBasic Ventilated and Adjustable laptop stand is perfect and produces the effect of a typewriter slant for those who grew up on IBM Selectrics or Royals. Fully adjustable for just about any angle you are comfortable with. Well made, light weight and it looks as a 'piece of the laptop' in sight. One small warning: the tabs on the front end that keep your laptop from sliding off may be a bit short for some laptops. The tabs rise only .75 of an inch (3/4). My current, and several past laptops, the front sits 1.0 inches (1) at top front but slanting down at .75 of an inch (3/4) inward. The slant keeps the tabs on the stand from holding the laptop in place - causing the laptop to slip down and off. Simple solution to this: Binder Clips. Use the medium size binder clip, one on each of the stand tabs. You can find 'binder clips' on the Amazon web site. A box is under 4 but you only need 2 medium binder clips so . . . check with a school teacher or office worker and get two for free. Other than that, the right tool at the right price. Buy one and see for yourself. You'll be glad you did. Can't seem to say enough about this awesome stand. This allows me to utilize my laptop monitor and a second flawlessly. The cord keep on the back is great as well. I am about to purchase another monitor and with the choices of adjustment angle, this stand should place the two screens side by side perfectly for that one as well.There is no vibration through the metal as the contacts on the bottom are padded. The fan on my laptop almost never comes on even during day long uploads to the cloud due to this stand having it suspended in air on mesh.Very, very glad I made this purchase. Easily worth much more than I paid, the options for adjustment angles are ample, and lets my expensive baby run cool. Buy with confidence! Can't seem to say enough about this awesome stand. This allows me to utilize my laptop monitor and a second flawlessly. The cord keep on the back is great as well. I am about to purchase another monitor and with the choices of adjustment \n"

      "We are unable to connect WIFI on this product. We have tried to follow the instructions to no avail. It is a useless and expensive item sitting on our table. Since I purchased returned couple of times now is dead I have to return it again. My first problem didn't paired. This review can not be valid due to the device did not work for me. I would put it down. Just upgraded to the ECHO instead of the tap. We were so excited to get the tap since it was a larger speaker than the dot and unlike the echo has a battery charger with it to make it portable. We already have an echo which works perfectly in our home. When listening to online radio on the tap it cut in and out constantly. We returned it and exchanged gor the dot. hard to use, and does not support Guam. online instructions not clear It's very tin sounding no bass sounds terrible bought a bose sound link and a amazon dot to hook up to it the speaker voice quality is terrible compare the similar size my logitech UE BOOM.the price is too high, even I got on promotion with $79 I spent more time trying get it functioning than I did actually keeping this product. After a couple of days and never getting it to understand or follow my commands I returned it to BB. Also it kept trying to sell me products which I really didn‚Äôt appreciate. Could not get it to work properly. I put the app on my phone and my computer. I reached out for help. They responded and it still didn't work. I finally got frustrated and returned it. Is Amazon kidding me They want me to pay 19.99 for an item that is a critical part of the functioning of their product Outrageous. I will find another 5V charger. I bought this thinking that I needed it but I didnt so it was a waste of money. I do so hate to waste money. the Kindle can hook to a regular cell phone charger and it comes with a cable that connects to the computer. For some reason I thought I just had to have this too when I bought my Kindle. One star because this should've been included when I purchased my Kindles. Bought this second one because I have three paper whites and got tired of playing musical charge chairs. And if Amazon would concentrate on the loyal e-book readers rather than the useless fires and increase memory more than the little bit they did on the latest kindle (I own one) I would be a happy camper. We need the option of adding memory (Amazon invent a chip that only you sell and the only one a kindle can use and I'll purchase). Just give us that option. Fires don't work for just straight up reading (can't read in any kind of light because of the shiny screen). Having to purchase these power adapters separately ticks me off. I don't care about the cloud. I need books downloaded to my devices. We vacation often in our mountain house. Middle of nowhere (which I like). However, no wifi, no Internet access and no cell coverage so cloud is useless. I guess I read too much. Thousands of books. 5,000+ in my library at home before a stroke forced me to Kindle and now thousands more. Include adapters when purchasing devices and increase the storage capacity. No reason. This product is described as 5W, 1 amp. The Kindle line is mainly 5V (4.8V, what's the difference) and around 1 amp, which is 5 Watts (5W). Why the mystery, guys Also, this deal is for US 110V market only I travel. I like that the previous simple FIRE charger was universal (i.e. 100V-240v). I like that the first Kindle charger was also universal. What are you people doing Or, is it that the copywriter in this case just doesn't understandFor those who don't understand the details of electricity, ANY device will tell you what it needs to feed. Voltage (V) is one thing to look at and your charger needs to say something within the range of 100 and 240 volts to meet your device need. As far as AMPS (A). If your device says it needs 1.8 A. It's perfectly fine to buy a charger that has a rating higher than that. Like 2 Amps. The device will only drink as much as it needs. A device that needs 1.8 A plugged into a 2 A charger just means the charger is taking a nap. Just avoid situations where your device needs more Amps than a charger can provide. It won't necessarily explode but it will extend charge times and is generally not recommended. My Kindle Voyage is nearly 16 months old and worked perfectly. I kept receiving emails from Amazon about the software update. I switched off airplane mode, switched on wifi and shortly after the screen locked up. I have tried everything with customer support and they now tell me I will have to buy a new one. I am very annoyed. If I had left the software as it was my Kindle Voyage would still be working. Very disappointed that my Kindle Voyage, purchased in April, failed after just two uses. Went to charge it tonight to take on a business trip and it won't charge, won't reset, etc. Since my Best Buy receipt says I only have 15 days to return it, tried calling Amazon support. Their only solution after over 30 minutes on the phone is to process a replacement which may be a new or may be a refurbished device-- unacceptable to replace a less than 2-month old device with a refurbished one... but, given the poor experience I've had with the Voyage, I'm not even comfortable with a 'new' replacement at this point. Amazon says they can't do anything about a refund because I purchased from Best Buy-- 15 days seems a little extreme in a situation like this with a defective product!Stuck with a $200 paperweight :-( very good produ ct and service will defintely refer to a freind. I am bring it back for an exchange. (a different make) If ads dont bother you, then this may be a decent device. Purchased this for my kid and it was loaded down with so much spam, it kept loading it up making it slow and laggy. Plus the carrasoul loadout makes it hard to navigate for kids, not very kid friendly! Oh you can pay $15 to remove the ads but it wont remove them all. Buy the samsung, better everything! Does not let me connect with my library. Very diapointed I liked it at first except the browser is kind of clunky. Also you can. It use all android Apps. The worst thing though was mine just stopped working in the middle of watching a movie on a long plane flight. It was fully charged. I have tried recharging and turning on etc. it is just a blank screen and off. Kind of a cool paperweight. Hope I can get my money back. Or get a new one. I bought this to replace a 3-year old Kindle Fire 7\" HDX that I had just dropped on the floor. I sort of panicked, so after doing a couple of hours of research I picked this tablet. Just to be on the safe side I got 16 additional GB of memory. I installed a couple of games (none of them memory hogs) and a cookbook app, in addition to downloading a couple of books and dictionaries. I can honestly say this is the slowest tablet I've ever had. Just rotating the screen takes 7-10 seconds, and that's if there's only one app open. Opening a book or magazine can take half a minute, and God help you if you want to switch between a recipe and a magazine while you're cooking! Amazon is obviously more concerned about showing you constant special offers and apps than having satisfied customers. Since there are no other Fire tablets available for whatever reason (maybe they're being discontinued?) I'll be replacing it with either an iPad or a Galaxy tablet. This thing lasted not even a month before it went dead. Going to try and take it back I have never had so many issues with a kindle and I have purchased alot. It's slow. It shuts off whenever it wants, the sd card dosent read half the time. And when it does it seems to be downloading it. And it deleted apps off my other kids kindle or adds when I do ... very very stupid . It has cracked . And I have never dropped it . It isn't made well. I am going to return it and I will probably never buy another kindle . HORRIBLE If adding more than one child to the account, the screen will not rotate properly for the second, third, or fourth child. Geek squad could not fix this problem, seems to be a manufacturer's issue. Also, there are too many adds. I returned this product. I bought this on line as a gift. The unit does not stay on and I cannot get in touch with anyone to get the unit repaired I bought this tablet for my 4 year old daughter. Too many advertisements. I would rather pay more and not have a single ad. not good, hate it , never buy it again, sucks. done Nothing but problems after a month. Luckily I could take it back and get a credit for the kindle to put towards an ipad. It started off working fine then after a month it started losing internet connection randomly (while the old ipad had no problems). Then it stopped charging, never got past 1%. Tried different outlets, different android chargers. Nothing. Worthless Bought this mostly as a backup.and to read a few books, since I have a larger cell phone and a back up. Used it occasionally may 40 or 50 hours of use till this week when I sent my laptop in for repairs. so I probably used it a tot this week. I was watching my 3rd Primetime video this week and it simply turned off. It will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode. It is gone, It is toast. Bought it October 11, 2016 , It quit on February 9, 2015. My old Fire lasted 4 or 5 years with more use. it had stereo speakers, lasted a week on a charge not 2 or 3 days.Sturdier built. This is full of junk, I am not just offered more apps, it is constantly trying to add them.

This is full of junk, I am not just offered more apps, it is constantly trying to add them. JUNK JUNK JUNK This is not a bad product. Amazon offers greats products but this tablet was missing features even for a basic tablet. The lack of google chrome compatibility made this tablet not right for me. horrible...just like the other 7 i have owned ONLY due to warranties The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It's going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey! Dont have option for password ask you before buying apps once you authorized as allow its done.Not as many free good apps Like apple have it I had to return this product as it was not compatible with things such as Facebook and Itunes... which is what I needed it for. Great if you are into books and streaming movies! I had to return this product as it was not compatible with things such as Facebook and Itunes... which is what I needed it for. Great if you are into books and streaming movies! I went with this tablet based on many good customer reviews, but my experience was not a good one. From the start I was on the phone every day for at least an hour with Amazon tech support for one issue or another. Most of the techs were very polite, but not all knew the product very well. At one point I asked one of them about trying to save some RAM and they kept referring me to the storage, which told me they didn't even know the difference between RAM and regular storage. The internet browser was basic and it ran very slow at times, even when all my other wifi devices ran great. Then a day would pass and I'd be trying to type an email and the keyboard would just stop working...wtf??? Come to find out it's a \"known issue\" and \"they're working on it\". After two weeks of one thing after another I got fed up and just returned it. I wanted it to work, and gave it a good run, but just not quality stuff. To me it was like Walmart trying to build their own computer when they're obviously not a computer manufacturer, neither is Amazon. If I were you I'd look at a regular Android tablet from a reputable PC manufacturer, which is exactly what I did next. I got an ASUS tablet for only a few dollars more, and it's unbelievable. 1000% better in comparison to the Amazon Fire HD8. Save yourself the aggravation and go with ASUS or some other company that is specifically in the computer business full time. Sorry Amazon, not this time! I brought this tablet during the Black Friday sale fast forward to Christmas when my 6 year opens it he was happy I set it up for him two days later it crashed never came back on. Blank screen. He was disappointed and so was I . I have only had this Amazon Fire Hd8 since December 6, 2016 and it has already quit charging. Didn't want to go to the sites amazon wanted me to. I bought this because I have ebooks in college. Not only could I not get my ebook. I called the school IT department. They could not either. My semester was already started. The sales representative at the store told me this is what I needed. I ended up buying a tablet from my phone carrier and my ebooks were right there in less than 5 minutes with the schools IT department help. I bought this because I have ebooks in college. Not only could I not get my ebook. I called the school IT department. They could not either. My semester was already started. The sales representative at the store told me this is what I needed. I ended up buying a tablet from my phone carrier and my ebooks were right there in less than 5 minutes with the schools IT department help. i Bought this around black friday for $60 hoping it would be awesome... it failed so hard i tried multiple different micro SD cards none of which were recognized and YES i formated them with every format i could think of ... Fat32, NTFS, Fat, Xfat... i even tried to have the tablet do it... didnt work... to make matters worse half the apps i wanted to use werent in the app store and i came to find out that it isnt linked to the normal google play store this tablet has its own app store which is missing many common apps... the main reason i bought this was to play clash of clans and i cant because it wasnt on the app store... i tried to also use aftermarket play stores to play COC but it didnt work... launched and played 1 time but didnt work or update after that... needless to say i returned it and bought a $250 samsung galaxy tab A 10.1 (2016 version) with S-pen and its WAYYYYY better... bottom line you get what you pay for... also hint the s-pen version has an extra 1 GB of ram over the non pen version... so you should get that if you can afford the extra $50... This Kindle is so overloaded with apps that I will never use. Despite what one of Best Buys' associates said, you cannot remove any of the Amazon apps. The apps take up too much of the memory. I have an I Pad and love but bought this as a backup for work. Unfortunately, it bogs down. I also don't like that Amazon wants access to too much info to set up email, so I won't use this for emails either. I will likely sell it on Craig's List for less than half of what I paid for it. I bought the kindle fire 8 for my husband and I to use. Neither one of us have been able to figure out how to use it. Every time we open it advertisements pop up. And we just try buttons to remove it. We cannot get it to rotate for our puzzles. Just too complicated to use and to navigate around. I will be returning it. We have an iPad and it's much easier. Freeze frequently... No way to trouble shoot or repair it... Slow response. Wait 5 sec to turn a page. Frustrating. Best Buy says too bad so sad for me. Worked great but after awhile I wouldn't unlock. After I'd enter my pin, the screen would go black. I took it to geek squad (luckily I bought the protection plan!) and told me they don't fix them they just replace them. So I got another one but that one did the exact same thing. Ended up returning that one too. This is not an upgrade by any means! My three year old kindle outperformed Oasis.Battery life better than a week with the lights on lowest setting Magnetic connector is poorly designed and grows weak Two pieces to keep up with; unsnaps constantly Amazon Customer Services promises it will resolved in an update I found this devices battery very poor and also didn't like this device can't support screen share capabilities with my Amazon Fire TV or Smart TV's. Too bad Amazon turned this tablet into a big advertising tool. Many apps dont work and the camera is not good. I liked it at first except the browser is kind of clunky. Also you can. It use all android Apps. The worst thing though was mine just stopped working in the middle of watching a movie on a long plane flight. It was fully charged. I have tried recharging and turning on etc. it is just a blank screen and off. Kind of a cool paperweight. Hope I can get my money back. Or get a new one. I bought a Kindle Fire 16GB for my 6 year old son in June. After 4 months the charging port came loose and the device will not charge. Best Buy is aware of the issue and will do nothing about it. Amazon will not warranty their product for more than 90 days and they said the charging ports often break if children are using them! They have no options to fix the device and only offer a small discount if I buy a new one. Amazon does not stand behind this product. They are aware of the defect and continue to sell these. The protector was not made for the Fire 7 as it was to large and had no directions that were coherent. Worse purchase from Best Buy ever. My first tablet was a Kindle. I was curious about the updated version. Very disappointed I I thought the buy For my child bc the kids mode but it was very poor I do not like this Tablet one bit. It has to be registered with Amazon for it to function and it failed every time. I finally had to resort to calling Amazon's customer service, also not an easy task, to get it registered. There seems to be glitch in the programming, because when it failed again, I had to follow the same steps all over again to get it registered. I would highly recommend skipping this tablet and getting one that is not tied to any one company's operations, programming, or software. Too proprietary, the apps my daughter liked I could not install on it for her so basically it was worthless for me and I returned it. Bought this mostly as a backup.and to read a few books, since I have a larger cell phone and a back up. Used it occasionally may 40 or 50 hours of use till this week when I sent my laptop in for repairs. so I probably used it a tot this week.

Great if you are into books and streaming movies! We purchased this tablet for our 5 y ear old since all the other kid-friendly tablets were limited it what they had on them. Something should be changed regarding the port for the charger. The little area with the small bar in it keeps bending to the point, 5 months later it broke off and of course the warranty has ended. I am over tablets. If you can buy it on black Friday for 25.00 bucks or less, it should be that price all year long. So now he has no tablet because I am not sending it out to have someone else's sent back to me..re-furbished. I am very disappointed. Purchased for my Father In Law - this was the most frustrating experience. Not user friendly - not friendly at all. Stick with a name brand tablet - Apple, Samsung, etc.. Avoid this device at all costs. I brought this tablet during the Black Friday sale fast forward to Christmas when my 6 year opens it he was happy I set it up for him two days later it crashed never came back on. Blank screen. He was disappointed and so was I . Difficult to purchase. No stock in 6 stores, no order online or ship to store available. When it did become available it did not work. Once it turned on, I couldn't get any further. I could not log onto wifi network, though other items in my household work. Also the product wouldnt move past setting up the clock. Tried 3 days, gave up and returned the item. I bought 2 of the Amazon Fire tablets because the sales guy said that they were great and ran really fast. I have very fast internet and this thing just barely chugs along. If you play a game, it constantly stalls and freezes. The sound quality when I play music is terrible. I was planning on buying one for each of my 9 nieces and nephews if they ran well but now I know that wouldn't work for them because they are horrible. Worst product ever. Constantly screwing up and filled with ads you have to pay to remove. Best Buy refused to help when I wanted to return it I bought this because I have ebooks in college. Not only could I not get my ebook. I called the school IT department. They could not either. My semester was already started. The sales representative at the store told me this is what I needed. I ended up buying a tablet from my phone carrier and my ebooks were right there in less than 5 minutes with the schools IT department help. Returned it. it was a poor reader and clearly would not last.. Gave it to my granddaughter and she loves it..I want to buy one for myself.... I don't recommend buying this. After 1 month of buying this, it won't charge or turn on. I bought this product 4 months back. It is very slow, i can't open any app in 15 seconds. OS is different than others so we can't get normal apps easily. Only one thing i can say is slow slow slow performance. I don't know how to replace it. Need some help from best buy people.I don't know whether i got defective piece or this is the actual performance This is unacceptable spend the extra money for a tablet without obtrusive software and advertising Its very cool great picture good sound. Was kind of disappointed that i couldnt make calls but overall great piece of hardwark I don‚Äôt care that you can‚Äôt change the tablet to run like as you wish. It‚Äôs pre installed menu is not something you can change. This is unacceptable spend the extra money for a tablet without obtrusive software and advertising This is my 4th Kindle, and the worst so far. It randomly locks up and require a restart to do anything. I've probably had to do this a dozen times in the last week. It's going back if they'll take it. I'm sure its a great product but there was something wrong with the one I ordered on target.com. My daughter opened it on Christmas morning and was so excited. We went to charge it and it wouldn't turn on. We tried holding the power button down for 40 seconds like the amazon website suggests, nothing, we left it charging for hours and still nothing. Very disappointed. This tablet shut down and never turned back on after a week of purchasing it. I had to return it and they were out of stock for exchange. Annoying. This tablet shut down and never turned back on after a week of purchasing it. I had to return it and they were out of stock for exchange. Annoying. The ads that pop up constantly make us almost unusable for kids. I thought this would be a great gift for a child until I got to the set up. The set up could not be completed unless a credit card number was entered. I refuse to put that type of information in the hands of a child so, I returned it. It‚Äôs great that you can enhance capacity via a memory card, but the fact that a brand new product stops working within an hour of opening it reduces confidence significantly Have owned IOS products as long as I can remember. Not on same level Bought this for my young son, because of the warranty. You are required to have a credit card stored in the account, and to turn on parental controls it blocks other features too like Alexa. This is the most ridiculous setup ever. I bought four fire tablets and each of them stopped charging immediately after the purchase. I wrote to Best Buy detailing the problem with the tablets and the fact I did not have insurance or the boxes to return the item. No response. Disappointed because I have made major and multiple purchases with this company. Won't make any more purchases from Best Buy. Returned within a week, did not like it. I didn't care for the ads every time I turned the tablet on. I don‚Äôt care that you can‚Äôt change the tablet to run like as you wish. It‚Äôs pre installed menu is not something you can change. The Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet no longer was able to charge less than six months after being received as a Christmas present. I contaced Amazon, assuming that the was a one year warranty. Amazon tech support navigated me through a number of trouble shooting steps and concluded that the Usb port is defective. I was then told that this product only has a 90 day warranty and the best they could do in give me a 10% on my next Amazon purchase! Wow! I have had this product less than 6 months. It shut down unexpectedly and would not restart. I contacted Amazon and the only help they could give was to hold the power button for 40 seconds and when that did not work I was told to buy a new one. Quality of a product is measured in warranty and support. This product comes with very little warranty. It's 2017 no reason this tablet cannot produce clear 1080 or higher resolution. I get it it's cheap and for that it's good but it just feels cheap and omg so manny pop up adds.. Comeon amazon Waste of money,You tube does not work on these tablets,so everything from there old tablet does not work on the new ones,so going back to the old ones and sending these back I bought a Kindle Fire 16GB for my 6 year old son in June. After 4 months the charging port came loose and the device will not charge. Best Buy is aware of the issue and will do nothing about it. Amazon will not warranty their product for more than 90 days and they said the charging ports often break if children are using them! They have no options to fix the device and only offer a small discount if I buy a new one. Amazon does not stand behind this product. They are aware of the defect and continue to sell these. The protector was not made for the Fire 7 as it was to large and had no directions that were coherent. Worse purchase from Best Buy ever. My first tablet was a Kindle. I was curious about the updated version. Very disappointed I I thought the buy For my child bc the kids mode but it was very poor This is not like other android tablets in a bad way. We purchased this tablet for our 5 y ear old since all the other kid-friendly tablets were limited it what they had on them. Something should be changed regarding the port for the charger. The little area with the small bar in it keeps bending to the point, 5 months later it broke off and of course the warranty has ended. I am over tablets. If you can buy it on black Friday for 25.00 bucks or less, it should be that price all year long. So now he has no tablet because I am not sending it out to have someone else's sent back to me..re-furbished. I am very disappointed. Purchased for my Father In Law - this was the most frustrating experience. Not user friendly - not friendly at all. Stick with a name brand tablet - Apple, Samsung, etc.. Avoid this device at all costs. Difficult to purchase. No stock in 6 stores, no order online or ship to store available. When it did become available it did not work. Once it turned on, I couldn't get any further. I could not log onto wifi network, though other items in my household work. Also the product wouldnt move past setting up the clock. Tried 3 days, gave up and returned the item. Worst product ever. Constantly screwing up and filled with ads you have to pay to remove. Best Buy refused to help when I wanted to return it Returned it. it was a poor reader and clearly would not last.. Gave it to my granddaughter and she loves it..I want to buy one for myself.... I bought this product 4 months back. It is very slow, i can't open any app in 15 seconds. OS is different than others so we can't get normal apps easily. Only one thing i can say is slow slow slow performance. I don't know how to replace it. Need some help from best buy people.I don't know whether i got defective piece or this is the actual performance Too bad Amazon turned this tablet into a big advertising tool. Many apps dont work and the camera is not good. I bought a Kindle Fire 16GB for my 6 year old son in June. After 4 months the charging port came loose and the device will not charge.

I was curious about the updated version. Very disappointed I I thought the buy For my child bc the kids mode but it was very poor I do not like this Tablet one bit. It has to be registered with Amazon for it to function and it failed every time. I finally had to resort to calling Amazon's customer service, also not an easy task, to get it registered. There seems to be glitch in the programming, because when it failed again, I had to follow the same steps all over again to get it registered. I would highly recommend skipping this tablet and getting one that is not tied to any one company's operations, programming, or software. Very cheap and was not impressed at all never again This is not like other android tablets in a bad way.

Tried 3 days, gave up and returned the item. I bought 2 of the Amazon Fire tablets because the sales guy said that they were great and ran really fast. I have very fast internet and this thing just barely chugs along. If you play a game, it constantly stalls and freezes. The sound quality when I play music is terrible. I was planning on buying one for each of my 9 nieces and nephews if they ran well but now I know that wouldn't work for them because they are horrible. Worst product ever. Constantly screwing up and filled with ads you have to pay to remove. Best Buy refused to help when I wanted to return it Returned it. it was a poor reader and clearly would not last.. I don't recommend buying this. After 1 month of buying this, it won't charge or turn on. I bought this product 4 months back. It is very slow, i can't open any app in 15 seconds. OS is different than others so we can't get normal apps easily. Only one thing i can say is slow slow slow performance. I don't know how to replace it. Need some help from best buy people.I don't know whether i got defective piece or this is the actual performance The screen breaks way to easy it drop one time broke Everything is locked out to Amazon, no compatibility with the Google Play Store and a lot of games the children play are on the Play Store. This product is bad because it is locked into only Amazon services. I purchased 2 of these as Christmas gifts for our niece and nephew. We decided to unbox them and charge them up to be ready for Christmas day. After opening them, discovered they will not allow you to install any free apps or use them for much unless registered with an Amazon account and credit or gift card. I had absolutely no interest in giving a 4 and 7 year old access to one click shopping on my account so we returned these for android type kids tablets. There may be some way around this restriction, but I didn't find it. The reviews on this on Amazon seemed awesome. Little did I know that there is a chronic problem with the port on these tablets. We just bought this for Christmas and went to charge it for the first time. Nothing. We already loaded (and paid for) several apps, and now we're out that money. Also the charging cord that came with it appears it has been used before - there's some wear at the edge of it. So I went online to see if I could find this issue and there it is - everywhere. This is a problem that has been around for years, but Android - who is the ultimate culprit, has failed to fix it at the source. When you plug in the charger, there's no 'click' so you know it's in place. It just slides in and out. We've had Apple products for several years and never had an issue, then the first Droid product we purchase can't even be charged from the beginning. This will be going back to BestBuy - and will buy another iPad Mini - costs more, but is much much more reliable. It would not turn on or charge. We have to return it to Kindle. I didon't care for this tablet, downloading apps outside of Amazon was really confusing. Bought this for my daughter(3) and she can't even use it because it is NOT kid friendly. It is so incredibly slow!! It freezes often and does not seem to work without wifi like it is supposed to. Also was supposed to come with a year free of Amazon free time and we have been charged for it every month !( it requires you to put a card number in before initial use. ) Keep calling Amazon and the foreign people can't seem to figure out the problem. Don't buy! So slow returning mine for something different any suggestions This is just a regular fire tablet that has protective case. I baught 2 for my kids, and figured that with the cover the the one year of freetime which includes all the videos, apps and games then it makes sense. I baught this one as a gift for a kid overseas, and all the content is not playing, when I contacted amazon, they said it's not for overseas, although I asked in Best Buy before I buy it and they assured me it works everywhere. It's totally overpriced for a tablet that doesn't play anything! Best Buy should know and let customers know specially when u ask specifically! Hard to connect to the internet. Extremely slow to load apps. Not many free apps like apple. The only thing I really like is the protection it offers. Cumbersome, complicated and not kid friendly..... went with Apple, suggesting you do too. Not able to play youtube that's what my daughter likes. This product wouldn't turn on nor charge and then store couldn't locate another one for me. This product is not user friendly much less kid friendly. Took them back for samsungs. did not power up...at all. I am so happy that my grand-niece wasn't here and doesn't know about this yet, she would have been crying. It takes forever to download apps. I'm returning it will be getting something else. The touch and loading the content is very bad, it doesn't respond quickly and it very slow I purchase this tablet for my son and it was very disappointing on the 3 exchanges I had to do. First the charger was not working, second the free time was not connecting and third exchange it was freezing. So many good reviews for this tablet but it did not work for me. 7 year old boy broke it in less than 2 months even with the bumper guard on. Won't power up. When it WAS working, very limited on storage. Ran out of space in 1 hour, so the wifi wouldn't work. Had go in and explain to him he couldn't download more than a hand full of apps at a time. Doesn't matter now since it won't even turn on or charge. Bought this mostly as a backup.and to read a few books, since I have a larger cell phone and a back up. Used it occasionally may 40 or 50 hours of use till this week when I sent my laptop in for repairs. so I probably used it a tot this week. I was watching my 3rd Primetime video this week and it simply turned off. It will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode. It is gone, It is toast. Bought it October 11, 2016 , It quit on February 9, 2015. My old Fire lasted 4 or 5 years with more use. it had stereo speakers, lasted a week on a charge not 2 or 3 days.Sturdier built. This is full of junk, I am not just offered more apps, it is constantly trying to add them. JUNK JUNK JUNK The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It's going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey! I had to return this product as it was not compatible with things such as Facebook and Itunes... which is what I needed it for. Great if you are into books and streaming movies! I bought this because I have ebooks in college. Not only could I not get my ebook. I called the school IT department. They could not either. My semester was already started. The sales representative at the store told me this is what I needed. I ended up buying a tablet from my phone carrier and my ebooks were right there in less than 5 minutes with the schools IT department help. I purchased 2 of these as Christmas gifts for our niece and nephew. We decided to unbox them and charge them up to be ready for Christmas day.

I didon't care for this tablet, downloading apps outside of Amazon was really confusing. After buying this tablet for my grandchildren I was going through the initial setup procedure.That's where I was surprised to learn that after using this tablet for a year I would be charged fees to continue with the selected programs I used for a year.Time to take it back to the store. No hidden fees. So slow returning mine for something different any suggestions This is just a regular fire tablet that has protective case.

Extremely slow to load apps. Not many free apps like apple. The only thing I really like is the protection it offers. Not able to play youtube that's what my daughter likes. I cannot believe i bought this junk. It's always in freezing mode and i have to reboot it multiple times within a given hour. None of the apps work properly. I have tried to update the op. system, but that didnt help. This product wouldn't turn on nor charge and then store couldn't locate another one for me. This product is not user friendly much less kid friendly. Took them back for samsungs. It takes forever to download apps. I'm returning it will be getting something else. The touch and loading the content is very bad, it doesn't respond quickly and it very slow Certified garbage! Lesson learned about paying attention to reviews. Fire TV box and remote was packaged like new, even included new batteries. After plugging it in it would only show Amazon logo and 'unknown boot' on screen. Cycled power several times and even tried to reset using remote buttons, no dice. I read all the negative reviews before I purchased this, I chose to take the chance so I'm angry with myself, but very disappointed with Amazon for even suggesting this is refurbished, let alone certified, as if that means something. Stay away from the certified refurbished Amazon Fire TV. I received two Certified Refurbished defective fire TVs. The first the screen looked half corrupted, see the pictures. The second Certified Refurbished Amazon fire tv I received would not boot up, it was stuck in an infinite loop where I would only see the amazon logo for 10 seconds then it would boot up again.If anything, Amazon needs to re-visit its refurbishment process and quality control of the refurbished products they let get in consumer hands.Update 11/28/16: I purchased a new Fire TV during the BF sale and I have had no issues so far :). I was initially happy that my Kindle replacement charging cord arrived so promptly, it seemed to work fine. But after only one use, the outer covering of the cord started cracking falling off in bits. It now is almost completely covered by electrical tape, as the bits fall off w/ each every use. I will end up having to buy a new one after all... Can someone explain to me why I can find hundreds and hundreds of people with this disintegrating isulation on charging cord problem, but not ONE post from Amazon with an official Company Statement about these defective, inferior, slave-labor built, imported, crap charging cablesAnyoneI'll be you dollars to donuts that these 100s of complains will bloom into 10s of thousands, as the existing, bad cables mature. (dry out, degrade, undergo radioactive decay, whatever their issue is). I'll bet I'll win! I am bring it back for an exchange. (a different make) If ads dont bother you, then this may be a decent device. Purchased this for my kid and it was loaded down with so much spam, it kept loading it up making it slow and laggy. Plus the carrasoul loadout makes it hard to navigate for kids, not very kid friendly! Oh you can pay $15 to remove the ads but it wont remove them all. Buy the samsung, better everything! Does not let me connect with my library. Very diapointed I liked it at first except the browser is kind of clunky. Also you can. It use all android Apps. The worst thing though was mine just stopped working in the middle of watching a movie on a long plane flight. It was fully charged. I have tried recharging and turning on etc. it is just a blank screen and off. Kind of a cool paperweight. Hope I can get my money back. Or get a new one. This thing lasted not even a month before it went dead. Going to try and take it back I bought this on line as a gift. The unit does not stay on and I cannot get in touch with anyone to get the unit repaired I bought this tablet for my 4 year old daughter. Too many advertisements. I would rather pay more and not have a single ad. not good, hate it , never buy it again, sucks. done This is not a bad product. Amazon offers greats products but this tablet was missing features even for a basic tablet. The lack of google chrome compatibility made this tablet not right for me. horrible...just like the other 7 i have owned ONLY due to warranties I went with this tablet based on many good customer reviews, but my experience was not a good one. From the start I was on the phone every day for at least an hour with Amazon tech support for one issue or another. Most of the techs were very polite, but not all knew the product very well. At one point I asked one of them about trying to save some RAM and they kept referring me to the storage, which told me they didn't even know the difference between RAM and regular storage. The internet browser was basic and it ran very slow at times, even when all my other wifi devices ran great. Then a day would pass and I'd be trying to type an email and the keyboard would just stop working...wtf??? Come to find out it's a \"known issue\" and \"they're working on it\". After two weeks of one thing after another I got fed up and just returned it. I wanted it to work, and gave it a good run, but just not quality stuff. To me it was like Walmart trying to build their own computer when they're obviously not a computer manufacturer, neither is Amazon. If I were you I'd look at a regular Android tablet from a reputable PC manufacturer, which is exactly what I did next. I got an ASUS tablet for only a few dollars more, and it's unbelievable. 1000% better in comparison to the Amazon Fire HD8. Save yourself the aggravation and go with ASUS or some other company that is specifically in the computer business full time. Sorry Amazon, not this time! Prior to using the device I decided to recharge it to 100% and was shocked to find out that it takes 6 hours. Unless you have a lot of time don't buy this device. We bought this earlier on line from another vendor and it was never delivered. Best Buy was great. I have only had this Amazon Fire Hd8 since December 6, 2016 and it has already quit charging. Didn't want to go to the sites amazon wanted me to. i Bought this around black friday for $60 hoping it would be awesome... it failed so hard i tried multiple different micro SD cards none of which were recognized and YES i formated them with every format i could think of ... Fat32, NTFS, Fat, Xfat... i even tried to have the tablet do it... didnt work... to make matters worse half the apps i wanted to use werent in the app store and i came to find out that it isnt linked to the normal google play store this tablet has its own app store which is missing many common apps... the main reason i bought this was to play clash of clans and i cant because it wasnt on the app store... i tried to also use aftermarket play stores to play COC but it didnt work... launched and played 1 time but didnt work or update after that... needless to say i returned it and bought a $250 samsung galaxy tab A 10.1 (2016 version) with S-pen and its WAYYYYY better... bottom line you get what you pay for... also hint the s-pen version has an extra 1 GB of ram over the non pen version... so you should get that if you can afford the extra $50... This Kindle is so overloaded with apps that I will never use. Despite what one of Best Buys' associates said, you cannot remove any of the Amazon apps. The apps take up too much of the memory. I have an I Pad and love but bought this as a backup for work. Unfortunately, it bogs down. I also don't like that Amazon wants access to too much info to set up email, so I won't use this for emails either. I will likely sell it on Craig's List for less than half of what I paid for it. I bought the kindle fire 8 for my husband and I to use. Neither one of us have been able to figure out how to use it. Every time we open it advertisements pop up. And we just try buttons to remove it. We cannot get it to rotate for our puzzles. Just too complicated to use and to navigate around. I will be returning it. We have an iPad and it's much easier. Freeze frequently... No way to trouble shoot or repair it... was cheap, can not run chrome stuff, returned to store. Worked great but after awhile I wouldn't unlock. After I'd enter my pin, the screen would go black. I took it to geek squad (luckily I bought the protection plan!) and told me they don't fix them they just replace them. So I got another one but that one did the exact same thing. Ended up returning that one too.\n"

      "Summary: The two tabs to keep your laptop from sliding off are not adjustable so when you are typing your arms want to rest on those tabs. So in the pictures you can see a slight modification I made to alleviate this problem. I used strips of thick felt with sticky bottoms. Simple but maybe on the next model.\n",

      "Summary: I was significantly disappointed to see that Amazon pushes ads through the Kindle when you put it into sleep mode, and throughout the store options. Pairing took forever to finish or work (had to try three different times) and if the unit sits for too long, I had to go through the entire pairing process again. Easy to carry in purse or pocket but doesn't do anything better than the cheapest Kindle reader.\n",

      "Summary: This is obviously the most refined Kindle on the market as of now. The ergonomics are just perfect, as there is no other Kindle or any ebook reader that is as easy to use single handed as this one. Fits perfectly in the palm and the page turn buttons are a joy to use. The battery life is astonishing, and the design is unique and extremely ergonomic.\n",

My son is 4 and sometimes he gets mad because tablet gets slow. Still good deal for 32gb, 1 year primetime for $80 Battery doesn't last the up to 7 hours estimate. Didn't even last 4 hours one day.

      "Original Reviews: My initial impression of this was very good. The material is nicer than the shiny stuff on my Hama CD binders and the netting trim gives a nice appearance compared to plain look of most budget CD binders.There are 50 pages with 8 disc pockets each (4 per side) giving a total of 400 capacity. The pages are hung from the spine in two groups of 25. By that I mean that 25 pages all have a single attachment point to the plastic spine.This is where the first problem with this binder lies. Because each group of 25 pages shares the same anchor point in the spine, the pages cannot sit flat once full of discs. They bend and arch, and apart from looking tatty this puts a lot of tension across the plast...\n",

Although only bad things are, it isn't comfortable sitting on your lap as the metal just isn't awesome. The rivets where you rest your hands are welded things and they're uncomfortable as they dig into your hands when trying to type or even resting your hands. Wouldn't recommend.. Too small for 17 he envy very tight fit. Otherwise great product Too many zippers IMO. Good quality, but the zippers frequently get caught making it slightly annoying to open.

      "Original Reviews: ASIDE FROM THE FACT THAT THE SCREEN IS SMALL, IT'S A GREAT LITTLE DEVICE. FOR THOSE THAT PREFER A LARGER SCREEN, THE ECHO SHOW WOULD BE A BETTER CHOICE. Simple in its design, with multiple angles, the mesh keeps your laptop cool, the cord keeper in back keeps organized, and the surface area is great for a 15.6 laptop. I think this would also work for a 17 laptop, but there may be a larger model for those. Check first. The only gripe I have about this unit is the two 'tabs' that keep the laptop from sliding down into your lap when adjusted up at an angle. These two tabs could benefit from being 1/2 taller than they are. This would allow a 'thicker' laptop base from 'spillage' like my Toshiba ...\n",
      "Summary: The two tabs to keep your laptop from sliding off are not adjustable so when you are typing your arms want to rest on those tabs. So in the pictures you can see a slight modification I made to alleviate this problem. I used strips of thick felt with sticky bottoms. Simple but maybe on the next model.\n",

After discarding and getting rid of broken cd cases, broken cds, and selecting those ones we really like, this binder turned up to be an excellent option to store our favourite cds and dvds and keep them in a small space at our living room, giving us the choice to donate or get rid of those cds towers that took a lot of room, despite looking nice.

Additionally, I was further frustrated by the fact that I learned there was a cellular version (available direct from Amazon) but not through the store. For such an expensive unit, to have ads with no option to disable them, seems unreasonable and like a rip-off. Additionally, the fact ...\n",

Easy to carry in purse or pocket but doesn't do anything better than the cheapest Kindle reader.\n",

We depend on AA batteries for many wireless microphone and have found that brand-name batteries last about a month per our usage. We switched to Amazon basics to try it out when a subscription for our preferred brand was no longer available and have found that, under the same usage, these batteries last about a week. That's a 1/4 capacity. First time I bought these they worked well and lasted almost as long as the name brands. Not the same this time around, almost no charge - 4-6 hours of run time - Junk batterie...\n",
      "Summary: These batteries don't last even in a simple digital clock. Date on the back of these were 1992. Battery storage life only lasted 8 months (stored indoors) During my first recharging they were leaking and wrapping was coming off. Will not buy again.\n",

Cameras were not exposed to cold temps more or less than other batteries. WE buy in bulk for the north house. Amazon Basics is great for things like sheets and beeding and towels. In my opinion the battery life, in the large package of aaa and aa size we purchased were lacking. If it's possible to have gotten a dud batch I sure got it.

These do not hold the amount of high power juice like energizer or duracell, but they are half the price. When I first started getting the Amazon basic batteries I really liked them. With recent purchases, they do not seem to last like they had, or maybe a mixed-bag (inconsistent with some lasting better than others).

      "Summary: We are unable to connect WIFI on this product. It is a useless and expensive item sitting on our table. My Kindle Voyage is nearly 16 months old and worked perfectly. I switched off airplane mode, switched on wifi and shortly after the screen locked up. I have tried everyth Just rotating the screen takes 7-10 seconds, and that's if there's only one app open. Amazon says they can't do anything about a refund because I purchased from Best Buy. Since there are no other Fire tablets available for whatever reason, I'll be replacing it with either an iPad or a Galaxy tablet. The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. The slot for the SD card is defective. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Great if you are into books and streaming movies! This is not an upgrade by any means! My three year old kindle outperformed Oasis. Magnetic connector is poorly designed and grows weak. Two pieces to keep up with; unsnaps constantly. Amazon will not warranty their product for more than 90 days. This is not like other android tablets in a bad way. Dont have option for password ask you before buying apps once you authorized as allow its done. Great if you are into books and streaming movies! This tablet shut down and never turned back on after a week of purchasing it. The ads that pop up constantly make us almost unusable for kids. Amazon does not stand behind this product. Won't make any more purchases from Best Buy. friendly - not friendly at all. Difficult to purchase. No stock in 6 stores, no order online or ship to store available. Amazon does not stand behind this product. They are aware of the defect and continue to sell these. The reviews on this on Amazon seemed awesome. We just bought this for Christmas and went to charge it for the first time. Nothing. it drop one time broke. When you plug in the charger, there's no 'click' so you know it's in place. It just slides in and out. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. 7 year old boy broke it in less tha n 2 months even with the bumper guard on. Won't power up. When it WAS working, very limited on storage. Ran out of space in 1 hour, so the wifi wouldn't work. roduct we purchase can't even be charged from the beginning. We have to return it to Kindle. This is just a regular fire tablet that has protective case. Hard to connect to the internet. Extremely slow to load apps. Not many free apps like appleo slow returning mine for something different. The Amazon Fire Hd8 has already quit charging. Save yourself the aggravation and go with ASUS or some other company that is specifically in the computer business full time. This Kindle is so overloaded with apps that I will never use. husband and I to use. Neither one of us have been able to figure out how to use it. We cannot get it to rotate for our puzzles.

The material is nicer than the shiny stuff on my Hama CD binders and the netting trim gives a nice appearance compared to plain look of most budget CD binders.There are 50 pages with 8 disc pockets each (4 per side) giving a total of 400 capacity. The pages are hung from the spine in two groups of 25. By that I mean that 25 pages all have a single attachment point to the plastic spine.This is where the first problem with this binder lies. Because each group of 25 pages shares the same anchor point in the spine, the pages cannot sit flat once full of discs.

      "Summary: There are 50 pages with 8 disc pockets each (4 per side) giving a total of 400 capacity. The pages are hung from the spine in two groups of 25. The charging port on the Paperwhite is so small that nothing that I already have will work. I was quite disappointed in the ability of Alexa to answer any serious questions. You need to memorize your command and speak it out, otherwise it may not understand your command. Google Home is smarter. If you need a basic tablet then the fire works. Tablet had trouble from the begging it kept restarting and rebooting. Bought it in order to watch NBC but the NBC app isn't compatible, so now I have a paperweight. ry powerful for the size and does everything! nice size, very clear but randomly shuts off. cant remove unwanted apps from the home screen. if you watch video..it buffers alot and laggs. Lots of ads pop up, and you can't use apps from non-Amazon sources unless you root it.  Kindle Fire seemed to work properly, however, the security, Webroot Anywhere, that was included was impossible to install. Good for reading but video quality is not so good. The cost is low and appreciate that. Good for reading but video quality is not so good. Takes an hour to charge the battery to 100% yet drains in 15 minutes. 4th generation has 2 speakers and sound is much louder than the current 5th generation. The battery lasts a mere 15 minutes as a portable unit. yet drains in 15 minutes. It's a good device for children because they don't know any better. The provided charging cable connector does not seat well into the tablet's micro USB port. The battery is having more and more trouble holding a charge. Audio is terrible, you could barely hear it so I returned it. Nice looking product, however, very little storage space. The opening screen has about 15 -20 apps. The charging plugs on these kindle damage way to easy. My kid refused to play games on this. Amazon Fire TV is a good device, but not great. I have to unplug / plug back in the HDMI cable on a regular basis when switching inputs on the TV. Touch response is not so good so my kid refused to play games on this. Small part of the adapter for this cord has stopped working. While plugged into a wall socket using Amazon's adapter, it does not charge at all. Tablet had trouble from the begging it kept restarting and rebooting. Bought it to watch NBC but the NBC app isn't compatible. Amazon Kindle Fire is slow to respond. When I'm on Facebook and click on an article to read, it goes to the page, and within 30 seconds, the page closes. Sometimes Facebook app won't even load.\n",

      "Summary: The rivets where you rest your hands are welded things and they're uncomfortable as they dig into your hands when trying to type or even resting your hands. Good quality, but the zippers frequently get caught making it slightly annoying to open. Too small for 17 he envy very tight fit. The Amazon quality is decent, but looks like a beer can cozy (koozie) compared to the CASE LOGIC. Great sound, it needs to be a little more sophisticated in responding to inputs. Good size screen and clarity for the money. Seems fairly robust. Downside is the ads that apparently can't be shut off. Viewing photos were not as clear as the original iPad mini even without retina display. low, and the camera isn't the best, but for the price it's fine. Good for our 5 yr old to use but we purchased this for her to do online curriculums, which is almost impossible to do with this tablet. Offers Alexa, but I haven't figured it out. The SDmini is great for reading but the lag time for loading videos was a little bit longer than an iPad. The OS is a bit clunky, and less intuitive then on higher priced tablets. Speed isn't great for web or certain gaming apps, but fine for books. The Fire HD8 will restart when the battery indicators is at 35%. The Amazon Fire is so ridiculously proprietary that I cannot watch any of my movies on it from my nook. The display is not as sharp and vivid as they say but still good. WiFi works well and internet browsing is fast. on ecosystem this will make a great tablet. For about 2.5x more money, consider an iPad instead. Works well but lacks forward control of screen and right and left movement on keyboard. Good for basic websurfing and email.\n",

      "Original Reviews: ASIDE FROM THE FACT THAT THE SCREEN IS SMALL, IT'S A GREAT LITTLE DEVICE. FOR THOSE THAT PREFER A LARGER SCREEN, THE ECHO SHOW WOULD BE A BETTER CHOICE. Simple in its design, with multiple angles, the mesh keeps your laptop cool, the cord keeper in back keeps organized, and the surface area is great for a 15.6 laptop. I think this would also work for a 17 laptop, but there may be a larger model for those. Check first. The only gripe I have about this unit is the two 'tabs' that keep the laptop from sliding down into your lap when adjusted up at an angle. These two tabs could benefit from being 1/2 taller than they are. This would allow a 'thicker' laptop base from 'spillage' like my Toshiba ...\n",
      "Summary: The two tabs to keep your laptop from sliding off are not adjustable so when you are typing your arms want to rest on those tabs. Voice enabled Alexa works but doesn't detect voice as easy as the Echo or Dot. The Kindle voyage is an improvement on the paper white. The 8-inch screen makes it very easy to use and read the print of books. Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load. The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post.  Kindle Paperwhite is a lightweight, long-lasting ereader that is much easier on the eyes than an iPad. Fits perfectly in the palm and the page turn buttons are a joy to use. Lack of built in Google apps is annoying but can be bypassed without rooting. This is a descent tablet for basic web browsing and videos. Buy the warranty if it's for a child. Add in a 128GB microSD card and you'll have tons of room for audiobooks, ebooks, music files, photos, and Videos. Lack of built in Google apps is annoying but can be bypassed without rooting. Main drawback: the constant advertising! You turn it on and get a ad. Let it sit for a moment or two, another ad. Not worth for the money. The Amazon Fire HD8 16GB is a excellent value and performs accordingly for it's price-point. Ease of use and integration with Amazon Prime makes the product worth every moment. Hardcore users may want an iPad. Amazon seems to subsidize the low cost of the item by requiring you to be solicited by ads and and use their apps. Amazon MayDay functionality is not available and this was unexpected. Easy to access the apps, but not always easy to quit.\n",

      "Summary: An elevated keyboard serves the purpose of 'tilting' the keyboard into a natural position for typing. The material inside for like the pockets and stuff is really flimsy. There are almost too many pockets and organizational compartments. This is Echo in baby size and portable. The Amazon Tap offers all of the conveniences of Amazon's Alexa in a battery powered portable bluetooth speaker. Sound quality is excellent, it is easy to sync via Bluetooth and gives you the ability to stream music when connected to wifi. Kindle is light, elegant and a pleasure to use. Good size screen to watch movies or read book. Very bright display, speedy processor, and solid feel. Would recommend to anyone who likes to watch videos/browse the web on the go. Great tablet for those invested in the Amazon system. Response is great, colors IPS panel great, no blue tooth. Playing games everything moves smoothly since it has more ram. This thing won't break if you drop it.  Kindle Oasis is really comfortable in my hand. Holds a charge incredibly well and very nice display to make reading fun. Page turner is easy to use and it reverses so you can hold with ei. 30 dollars for tablet on Black Friday. Thinner profile and much nicer screen image are immediately noticeable. Features awesome child appropriate shows, videos and apps. Easy set-up with simple parental control. The Amazon Fire HD 8 Kids Edition tablet comes with a durable case that resists damage. The 8-inch high-definition display offers immersive play or viewing. A parental dashboard lets you set up appropriate content or time limits. Amazon Fire Kids Edition tablet has expandable memory of up to 128GB. Thousands of child-friendly e-books, TV shows, games and educational apps. Smaller than an iPad and has a better price. This is a durable tablet geared for younger kids. They can download games for their age level. Easy to use. Great apps and love it comes with 2 year warranty. Must have for my 2 kids. Amazon Fire HD8 is an extremely good value. It's not as powerful as an iPad but the price can't be beat. With Amazon prime you get free movies, books, and games. The tablet's light weight makes it very portable. The kindle is easiest to use, graphics and screen crisp, clear, brilliant colors. Netflix and Hulu works awesomely! This is a step up from what my son was using. The Fire HD8 and HD7 are amazing for the price. They aren't top powered tablets, but they're functional tablets. Only complaint is that it don't have a true GPS chip.\n",

      "Summary: The battery life is astonishing, and the design is unique and extremely ergonomic. The touch control, page change controls, are a little to sensitive. Web browser \"too\" experimental. This one is the smallest of all the kindle products I believe, and that's a big reason I picked. Two negative points are the Amazon logo in the cover, and the fact you can't do inverted text (black background white text) Those 2 points dropped it from 4 to 5 star for me. Still highly recommended. This is obviously the most refined Kindle on the market as of now. Fits perfectly in the palm and the page turn buttons are a joy to use. The charging case can be removed while reading and it snaps back easily.  Kindle Paperwhite should do just fine. Easy to handle. Light weight. I like that it automatically shuts off when the cover is closed. For occasional readers it might not make sense to spend so much. The only real justification for buying this kindle is if you miss the page turn buttons and want to pay top dollar for them. Great for reading in the sunlight, and easy on the wrist. Great product, but a little speedy. Would give it a 5 star if the battery lasted as long as they claim. But it's worth the extra charging times for the nice design. So light and easy in your hand especially without the cover. Using the cover is comfortable as well. The wifi connectivity is patchy at best. I have to go upstairs in my home and stand close to the router for the Oasis to connect, this is very annoying. For a product of this price, it shouldn't be missing any features. I absolutely love this reader. The bigger screen is wonderful. My only complaint is the battery does not last as long as advertised. There's no doubt that this is the best Kindle device available. This product may be extremely overpriced, but it also lives up to everything it's promised. It's a lightweight, long-lasting ereader that is much easier on the eyes than an iPad. It is much lighter and more ergonomical than a paperback. This is obviously the most refined Kindle on the market as of now. The ergonomics are just perfect, as there is no other Kindle or any ebook reader that is as easy to use single handed as this one. Fits perfectly in the pal. The charging case can be removed while reading and it snaps back easily, you do not have to deliberately align it properly. Once the case is connected it starts charging the Kindle which prolongs its battery life. I like that it automatically shuts off when the cover is closed. The Oasis' buttons have removed that issue and I am delighted! The weight and thinness of the device are also appreciated tho the paper white etc are pretty thin already. The screen is clear and bright, I can't see any LED issues others have complained about. Ultimately the only real justification for buying this kindle is if you miss the page turn buttons and want to pay top dollar for them. Great for reading in the sunlight. As well as light, and easy on the wrist. Battery life is poor. 50% drained on stanby in under a week. Lasts better if you keep wifi bluetooth off. Nice quality leather and I love the merlot color. Page turn buttons are easier to use than the buttons on the voyage. Screen looks the same even though they claim there are more backlights on this one. Love bigger screen, bold fonts, auto rotate & ability to hold it with one hand. Hate slippery aluminum backside. Where did the grippy textured surface go? So easy to drop. The Oasis has a very sleek design that is very comfortable in hand. Backlight is great and its nice to be able to have it adjust automatically or manually. Menus are easy to access an understand. Wifi works great. Only downside is the battery life is not good.\n",

      "Original Reviews: best e reader to date. yes it's a bit pricey, but it reads like a real book. Pricey? Yes... For serious readers and users of library e-books, completly worth it. While nothing beats a real book experience, traveling 4 days plus per week nothing beats the portability and ability to add from the library or Amazon on the fly... Never have to seek out light to read by (a noticeable improvement in the backlight), exceptional direct sun readability, not affected by polarized sunglasses... Great battery life... Great build quality... I expect it to last a long time... Only upgraded as I lost my last kindle on the train. Very happy and satisfiedEasier to handle. Fast charging Easy on the eyes. Small...\n",
      "Summary: Best e reader to date. yes it's a bit pricey, but it reads like a real book. For serious readers and users of library e-books, completly worth it. The Kindle Oasis is very tiny, portable & fits in about anything from a jeans back pockets to a very very small purse! The clarity of the screen is awesome. The touch of it works perfect! Very different than my HDX BUT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it! This is my 4th kindle and is easily the best one I've ever had. The color Merlot is beautiful and I've had it for three months and traveled with it and there have been no damages. The battery life is so long I have only charged it three times since owning it and I read anywhere from 3-5 hours a day. BestBuy delivered this on the day of release. Amazon still seems to be back-ordered. Wife love it, reads a lot and this is her go to reader. The reader is very lightweight and can be held in one hand for hours. The 2017 Kindle Oasis is the best and well worth the cost. It is fast, and that seemingly minor screen size bump actually is very big when you use the device to read. Leather cover must be purchased separately but is worth it to protect the screen and it looks great. The Kindle Oasis is very tiny, portable & fits in about anything from a jeans back pockets to a very very small purse! The clarity of the screen is awesome! The touch of it works perfect! Very different than my HDX BUT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it! This is a great device. It is ultra light, and a pleasure to use. It also has a very satisfying premium feel. If you use audible or like to read near water (poolside or in a bath) this would be the e-reader to go with. BestBuy delivered this on the day of release. Amazon still seems to be back-ordered. Wife love it, reads a lot and this is her go to reader. The Oasis is nearly a square shape at about 5\" wide by 5.5\" tall. The Oasis and its battery-charging cover together weigh only one ounce more than the latest Paperwhite with no case. The Oasis is an extremely lightweight reader that's easy on both your arms and your eyes. The ergonomic design is wonderful and makes it a breeze to hold. The 10 LEDs look fantastic and I love the return of page buttons. ttery cover are worth the additional expense. This Kindle reader with cover attached is light weight and easy reading. Can flip page smoothly and is very easy to use.\n",

We depend on AA batteries for many wireless microphone and have found that brand-name batteries last about a month per our usage. We switched to Amazon basics to try it out when a subscription for our preferred brand was no longer available and have found that, under the same usage, these batteries last about a week. That's a 1/4 capacity. First time I bought these they worked well and lasted almost as long as the name brands. Not the same this time around, almost no charge - 4-6 hours of run time - Junk batterie...\n",
      "Summary: These batteries don't last even in a simple digital clock. Energizer and Duracell brand lasted a month in my electric toothbrush. Do not plan on purchasing again in future as the batteries are ineligible for a return. Batteries don't last!!!! All but about 4 were duds. Half of each box came without power and the ones that did were half life. Not worth the money atany price, except maybe free.  Costco batteries became our go-to batteries until last year 2015 when they started leaking, even on the shelf. On second use, silver liquid leaked out of batteries, almost ruining the motor of a breast pump. Not something I would trust to stock up with for a power outage. Lasted less than half the time of a Duracell alkaline battery in the same conditions. Amazon should never have put their name on such a poor product. Not worth the savings. Out of 9400 reviews nobody noticed the size issue with these Not good. Last a few days in xbox controller. Energizer lasts months. Bought two packs of these on subscribe and save in the last couple months. So far out of 5 batteries used 2 were DOA, 2 lasted 4 days and 1 got so hot the plastic around the end is burnt. Are not strong enough to work the remote to my smart tv.\n",

      "Original Reviews: In my opinion these did not last anywhere near as long as Duracel in things like LED candles (which is crazy) and trail cameras. Cameras were not exposed to cold temps more or less than other batteries. WE buy in bulk for the north house. Amazon Basics is great for things like sheets and beeding and towels. In my opinion the battery life, in the large package of aaa and aa size we purchased were lacking. If it's possible to have gotten a dud batch I sure got it.

For example the magic touch counting toy, the store batteries lasted...\n",
      "Summary: In my opinion these did not last anywhere near as long as Duracel in things like LED candles (which is crazy) and trail cameras. Some of the four packs (02-2027) are bad upon first use. They last a day in an xbox controller, if you're lucky. These batteries die out a lot faster than the Duracell batteries we normally purchase. The clock mechanism stopped working twice and doesn't work at all now. They even leaked that battery acid out after a few hours of use. The outer cardboard box is frustration-free, but the batteries are tightly shrink-wrapped in groups of four. In our Xfinity TV remote, these last 25 of the time the Duracell's lasted. Overall, they don't have lasting power like the top brands. I paid 12.49 for 48 batteries. They only lasted 1 day. Replaced with Energizer batteries and they are still going strong. Will not be buying more. The green seal fell off of two of the five batteries as I removed them from the compartment. The acid left a 2 stain on my table. One day they were good with 50-90 power left, and they died suddenly the next day. cut price batteries. These batteries drain quickly. While you get a lot of them, the quality just isn't there. Not great for gaming or heavy use, otherwise they're nice backups. These batteries are good to poor in performance. They start good and quickly drain down to poor. Under heavy load they drain very quickly. Extremely limited shelf life so don't buy these in bulk. These batteries don't even last 3 days. 8 hrs of use at the most!  AA Performance Alkaline batteries 3-1/2 months ago. 10 year storage life is a joke. bout half as long as (Wegmans) store-brand AA batteries. Will not buy again. name brand batteries I have bought. I get approx half the life from these batteries compared to Walmart RayoVacs and then there's cheap. These last half the time the C's house brand batteries, (in the same unit) for only just a little less money. Batteries didn't last a year. Last several batteries were dead. 2 way radio drained batteries daily so too expensive. Go with a brand name. atteries I've purchased. Very poor quality. Lasted on one week in motion sensor that is used infrequently. Very short lifespan. Duracell and Energizer are much more dependable have a reliable run-down pattern. box without the individual plastic wrap. Will not buy again with this packaging. Rav-o-vac or a grocery store brand. They're cheap but we went through these in less than half the time of the previous pack. Each set of 4 batteries is individually shrink wrapped and very difficult to get apart. I retract my previous review. The green seal fell off of two of the five batteries as I removed them from the compartment. The acid left a 2 stain on my table. The batteries were my second foray into Basics product lines outside of the oh-so-dependable-cables arena. They never lasted more that a few hours and got really dim. Maybe these are good for other applications, but disappointed with their performance. Batteries did not last very long! Batteries do not last used all 48 after thanksgiving ned replacing to replace. Buy a known brand. Not worth the price. The batteries go dead very quickly. Only lasts half as long as the Rayovacs i usually purchase. Cheap Rayovac batteries from Menards (48AA for about 13.00) perform much better.\n",

      "Original Reviews: I order 3 of them and one of the item is bad quality. Is missing backup spring so I have to put a pcs of aluminum to make the battery work. These do not hold the amount of high power juice like energizer or duracell, but they are half the price. When I first started getting the Amazon basic batteries I really liked them. With recent purchases, they do not seem to last like they had, or maybe a mixed-bag (inconsistent with some lasting better than others). I have not done any tests, but feel some other brands may last longer. However, the price is hard to beat. Bought these batteries for my Christmas gifts the month of (december) only lasted like 2months toys now need replacement batteries . ...\n",
      "Summary: The Amazon Batteries lasted for about 10 days and the Duracell lasted for 12. They didn't last as long in my remotes and RC transmitters as even other store brand alkaline batteries. They definitely aren't for heavy use and the price point reflects that. of the battery that are a pain to remove. Batteries are notably less long-lived compared to other brands. Medium durability. Gonna buy Duracell in future. Do you have great quality rechargeables? These batteries don't seem to last as long as Kirkland brand or Duracell. Not optimal for devices that are constantly on. Each set of 2 would make it about 1 day of constant family gaming/TV usage. Batteries last a long time and does not leak even after it runs out of juice. Do not last as long as Copper Top! Jury still out. Only 32 batteries in the package when advertised as 36. ice faster than Duracell or Energizers. Not a bad price but after few times I realize these battery run out very fast. Perhaps they would be great in a remote or something that draws very little. Price is really good for the amount. I just wish the buttons lit up on the bagel and frozen buttons. Also, the slots aren't long enough or deep enough for a good sized bagel. The price was great for these batteries but they don't last for very long. It's like they just don't have a lot of power. I will not be getting these again. Made in the USA would make this a 5 star maybe it's just me... but they don't seem to last very long. Find these batteries have to be replaced more frequently than other bands when used in the same application/device. re batteries... we've gone through the package really quickly. Nothing special, just alkaline disposable AA batteries at fair price. ok Ok OK for AAA needs okay Okay, but do not last long. Only reason is I meant to get AAA not AA :( poor quality short life cannot recharge Put in my mouse for just 3 days. Runs out fast Runs out of power fast. Seems as good as Duracell but can't really tell. Seems like it doesn't last as long as other battery brands. seems to not last very long, curious. The price and packaging on these batteries is wonderful, but the use-life is not. A pair of these, fresh out of the box, did not last 30 days in my Bluetooth mouse. The batteries themselves come pre-wrapped in groups of four! New group of four, and they come wrapped in that horribly annoying cellophane like substance that is hard to remove. These are good if you're broke and just need to get by. They don't last as long as other brands or rechargeable batteries. If you have the money, invest in batteries that last longer and tax the environment less. Batteries are packaged by 4s and the plastic is really hard to get off. Not lasting very long. In comparison to Duracell they seem to last about 75 as long. Rayovacs cost a little bit more per battery, but they hold more energy. These batteries are only OK. They don't last as long as Duracell and when they die, it's usually instantly. One moment they seem to work fine, the very next moment they are outputting half power. The batteries are such a great deal but don't have the strength needed to run certain toys. We hve a snap circuit kit and it doesn't power it enough to make the fans fly. I will stick to Kirkland orDuracell from now on. stopped working within an hour and when I put new batteries in them, they worked fine. Made in the USA would make this a 5 star maybe it's just me... but they don't seem to last very long. . It's hard to remove the cellophane like substance that is hard to removal. It must be terrible for the environment. you're just going to split up some sets, you have to open a new group of four, and they come wrapped in that horribly annoying Cellophane.\n",

AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48-Pack) from AmazonBasics. Good quality, seem to last a good long time. Would compare to Energizer or Duracell. in remotes or such but flashlights will drain them quickly. Great price to replace all those batteries in electronics. Very impressed with the run time and the price is right (especially if you are a Prime member.) ProCell alkaline AAA cells have the highest open circuit voltage I've ever measured. Sadly, they are a too-tight fit to use in my recent Surefire Titan (flashlight) one AAA cell. Costing less than 25 cents per cell, they cost about 40-50 less than name brand batteries. Works just as good and lasts just as long as the name brands. Gives very good light intensity, albeit first few uses. Good, reliable batteries. Don't seem to last as long as the big name brands. For the price you will get more run time per money spent. Would recommend! eries are a bit longer lasting, but these suit me just fine.

The kindle is good to download apps for books catch up with reading. ordable and it had Increased storage but no backlight and the screen could be better! I love having real books, but these are great for travel and keeping your bookshelves lighter. I wish you could buy them with larger storage without having to buy the larger size pad. It also sucks that they are 4gig, but 1gig is taken up by the OS and advertising. Lame. I thought it would be as big as small paper but turn out to be just like my palm.

      "Summary: I love the bigger screen but do think this Fire HD 10TH runs a little slow. Nice size works fine needs to weigh a little less. Easy to set up and child and adult user griendly. Pictures and graphics are of very good quality. The tablet's size is a little big for just holding it and for carrying it around. Hard to find a case for this latest kindle. The 10\" is great viewing, especially for the older eyes. I could not get all the aps I wanted. Would recommend if on a budget. Good easy read easy on the eyes and perfect for travel. Easy to figure out and I like the paperwhite because it doesn’t strain your eyes. Bought one for my mom too and she loves it. The only con is the touch sensitivity could be better, but not bad for $60 on sale. The Kindle 8 is an inexpensive eReader that does what I need in the smallest, thinnest, lightest package. Use the Kindle apps on Android phones and tablets, but apps don't support family sharing. Bought this for my 90+ year-old, totally no-tech mom. She likes the size and ease of use. This is the perfect reader. Price is great, it's easy on your eyes. Battery lasts longer than a tablet. Easy to use interface. Ads can be kind of annoying, but keeps cost lower. . This was purchased as a replacement for one that was dropped one to many times. Hope this one lasts as long and stands up to the abuse the first one endured. It is so practical for reading along with my daughter. The Kindle Fire gives off too much glare to use in sunny conditions. The main drawback is that the graphics aren't as clear with this reader. Bought for my granddaughter she loves it. Kindle without a backlight is a nice solution to that problem. The recent sale price made it practical to get one, and I'm glad I did. Easy to read and maneuver. Just the right size. Only flaw is that it is not backlit, so in order to read in the dark I need a book light. The advertised month long battery life is just standby time. e device is great for it price. Lots of features. Great! It's very good. I will buy it next time. Thanks. Great product and reasonable price! Suitable for everyday use This devices is great for storing all my amazon books. It is also very light and portable. Simple to use as well. As always, great job! Very easy to use and it's always with me. This is my eighth Kindle. Some others were either lost or screen-damaged. Current model is better looking than earlier versions (white case), sturdier, and has an improved screen. This is more a no-frills Kindle compared to the ones that had keyboards and nicer back-lit features. Make sure to get it on sale. Battery is great, visibility is great (even though it's not a \"paperwhite\"), and form factor is comfortable. Nice product, great price and expandable storage unlike the HD version. Item work well and was easy to read from in day light BestBuy was offering some discounts during Thanksgiving. Works best with English books, does not work that well with native books.\n",

Downloaded movies for my son to watch and the audio is terrible, you could barely hear it so I returned it So I bought my little guys these tablets... so that I could repossess my IPad. Love the free time app but who could've imagined they wouldn't play NETFLIX!! So now... I'm out the money for the tablet and still don't have my iPad back... and yes, I called Amazon numerous times... they work after the fix, but the next time they go to use them they don't work again... the fix takes several minutes as it's force stopping the app, clearing cache ...\n",
      "Summary: The charging plugs on these kindle damage way to easy. Downloaded movies for my son to watch and the audio is terrible, you could barely hear it so I returned it. When this item is charged it works great, but it takes too long to charge. Asking my 3 year old to wait about 3 hours (no exaggerating) is a bit much. My niece has this same tablet and it take about 45 minutes to charge once it is fully dead. This thing may go back to the store as soon as tonight. You can not block Bing and it shows \"trending now\" News content. This can not be deleted or blocked. It also types ahead and adds content. This is a good tablet for children and adults too. However there is an issue with the port and charger cable. Got this for my 9 year old and several games that he wants to play are not accessible on this tablet. I would not buy another. Memory on it is lacking for 8 gig. Freezes up often and games don't always load. Prob good for price but to many bugs. The opening screen has about 15 -20 apps. It worse than a normal adult tablet. My kids dont use it at all because we have to unlock it for them everytime. I know the iPad quality is probably the best quality but it's way under that! Very frustrating. Will be returning it. Maybe I had higher expectationin general i will not recommend since the service of Amazon solving situations is not as good. I purchased this less than 2 months ago and it has already quit working. It will not charge and it will no longer power on. All I have is a black screen. I would not recommend this product.\n",

      "Original Reviews: I bought this for my daughter. It was bundled with a solid bumper case and has a kid mode interface. She insisted on using her brother's iPad constantly. Not to say there is anything wrong with this product, it just wasn't for her. Thought this would be perfect for my two children. The case, warranty and pass to download unlimited apps seemed great. However, the pad is sometimes unresponsive and inaccurate-which can be frustrating for children. The case is a little too bulky. And it can be confusing for children who want to push an icon to play but it instead downloads. There is a definite learning curve that they will overcome in time but it could be more user friendly for younger users. Th...\n",
      "Summary: The case is a little too bulky. It can be confusing for children who want to push an icon to play but it instead downloads. Not recommend for kids over 10 years old. cause tablet gets slow. Still good deal for 32gb, 1 year primetime for $80 Battery doesn't last the up to 7 hours estimate. Watches video mostly but should last longer than that. it has great durability, but lacks great sound. The picture quality is just ok. This makes for a decent tablet for a kid with the kids edition, but I'm not sure I'd want it as an adult. There are much better tablets on the market. Works fine on wifi, otherwise a little slow. My kid enjoys it though. . My 4yr old was able to operate it flawlessly. The included case works its magic to keep the tablet from any accidental screen cracks. The layout of the tablet is good. Internet is terrible. It's ok but I rather have bought Samsung Galaxy Tab. The tablet is pretty good, I would give it 5 stars if you are able to download an use apps from the Google store, that is one of my only big complaint. With four kids using tablets as reward time it helps the kids free time is awesome. The lower rating is because the charging port was extremely loose, as the cord falls out ALL the time! Very Frustrating! Limited activities for my son to surf the web and do the things he likes to do! I love this tablet and the games. But battery sucks. It goes dead really fast and it freezes up a lot. Only good for kids and games. thing in this instance) case. It offers great protection for use with kids but is a little pricey for the lackluster performance. Great for kids. My daughter lovethis tablet.. only problem is it cant connect to my home wifi which is verizon Tablet is great. It's a good piece of technology it's just not connecting to the wifi It's nice to have parental controls, but app grouping and bugs with apps hurts the experience. Parents will still need to look over child's shoulder to ensure games/apps are appropriate. Build quality is great and the image is very good, but the software is mediocre at best. Battery dies after an hour...should last longer for the money. Needs to be more simpler. parental contorl still need to be better. 2 year old suster they both live it it was great for reading but the lag time for loading videos was a little bit longer than an iPad. Kids will love this tablet, has a camera and kids can make movies with it. Wonderful for a child with a good imagination. I bought this for my two year old grandson but the restrictions were too much. These are great tablets for the kids and the price is wonderful with the warranty and the soft, yet bulky (a good thing in this instance) case. Good for little kids, it runs a little slow though Great for the kids but not much space for all the apps they want. Good features for kids, but definitely not enough storage. I would would not recommend this for a child. It's not kid friendly at all. I have purchased 4 of them for my grandson and nephews and 3 was was damaged within a couple months. Overall I wasn't too impressed with his tablet. ferred an iPad over the Kindle Kids version. Wish it was a bit faster loading and browsing, but functions as you would expect for kid friendly product. Would spend the extra money next time for a tablet designed for adults but had strong parental controls. This is the 2nd one I have bought. The first one went out before the 1 year. I contacted Amazon and the warranty for these was only 90 days. It is a good tablet for kids, but if you are looking for something long term. sues thus far.

      "Original Reviews: Bought this for my 2 yr old daughter. She was able to use it within minutes. She loves bed it, plays games on it everyday as well as we bought apps to read to her. She loves it all. Best buy ever for my 3 year old. Only purchased because they were out of the Galaxy tablet. I'm glad. This tablet is PERFECT for my 3 year old. I love that it has 2 modes. The kids mode sometimes freeze and takes a minutes for apps to open. Also didn't download Netflix movies like indicated. But regular mode works great. My daughter loves watching weird homemade youtube movies anyway. My Grandson can't put it down! With access to so many educational apps and games, you really can't lose. My son really enjoys this...\n",
      "Summary: Bought this for my 2 yr old daughter. She was able to use it within minutes. She loves bed it, plays games on it everyday as well as we bought apps to read to her. Best buy ever for my 3 year old. My daughter absolutely loves her new tablet. The free year of Amazon Freetime is an awesome bonus!! The only problem I have with it is that whenever your wifi gets turned off and then back on, your apps on the kids profile have to load again. Great for a 2 yr old, and will use it till he's older. You can set a time limit for how long you want your child to play or use the Fire. Great parental controls and great array of downloadable content. This is a good entry tablet for toddlers. Great variety of apps, books, and educational videos for her to explore. Only down side is the YouTube for kids app isn't available for the kindle fire. Great for the kids to play with and easy to monitor their time spent on it and the content they can access. Lots of free content, keeps them busy when need be. A little slow but overall good first tablet for kids. This tablet is great for kids, but also for adults who want something they can share with their children. You can set time limits for your kids and it helps a lot with limiting time. The Amozon Fire was a good substitute for TV watching. Durable, reliable, perfect for when you need a few minutes of quiet time. Charger provided was flimsy, but any mini-USB works better. Great for the kids. Sometimes have issues with the charging mechanism. This is the third Kindle Fire in my household, but the first kid's edition. It's very intuitive if you've ever used another android style device. Some of the apps are great even for my 9 month old daughter works great to keep her entertained. The battery lasts about 4.5 hours before needing a charge. Great generic tablet for looking to keep kids occupied. Mine enjoy the FreeTime Unlimited, and the child restrictions are great for my needs. Only minor issue ive noticed is having connection issue with networks at times. This is a great little phone. It feels like a true moto phone. While it's not on par with the $600+ phones... Dollar for dollar, it is well worth the cost. The protective foam layer is awesome. Great entry level tablet for kids without the worries of easy breakage. Charging port is weak and having a hard time charging My granddaughter loves it. The Fire OS with Freetime Unlimited (free for 1 year) is an excellent environment. Tablet is nice to play movies for kids. The amazon free play is Ok. With the increased number of games and apps, downloaded on the Tablett, it slows down in speed. The screen cracked a month ago and Amazon promptly replaced the device without incident. Best tablet for this age and in this price range. No google play store, slow sometimes, have to re-download apps frequently when running out of space, lack of popular apps. Large enough to see and hold, but small enough to carry. Easy to use and can download favorite stuff. Cons: like most androids it tends to freeze.\n",

      "Original Reviews: great tablet for kids when traveling. my grandchild loves it. Kindle products are fantastic. I've used a kindle & now have a Kindle fire. Use it everyday, so naturally, I would select a Kindle for my granddaughter. My little girl loves her Kindle. I'm so happy I bought an upgrade to her previous kindle. Best Christmas gift ever. Keep your child entertained with this Amazon Fire Kids Edition tablet. Thousands of child-friendly e-books, TV shows, games and educational apps accessible through this tablet engage your child in a healthy way, while its kid-proof case prevents easy damage. An expandable memory of up to 128GB on this Amazon Fire Kids Edition tablet provides plenty of storage. movies...\n",
      "Summary: great tablet for kids when traveling. my grandchild loves it. A Kindle that has a case to help with drops. Purchased on sale during Black Friday. The modified Android operating system with Amazon features built-in is great. Great value tablet for the little ones. Great warranty, great parental controls. Best money I ever spent for my grand child. Tons of fun apps, videos and books. Amazon Fire Kids Addition is a great way to give a kid something both fun and educational. Comes with a year subscription to amazons free time unlimited, which I interpreted as basically Prime for kids. This is a great tablet for kids as it is not too expensive and there is a 2 year warranty. Has been very durable with kids and easy to use. Holds charge well. Portable. reaks within 2 years, they replace it. The Kindle Fire is small but does everything it should for a young child. The free time app keeps the kids out of my files and prevents them from messing with tablet settings. It's perfect for curious fingers prone to swiping and clicking wherever. The tablet is just what a child needs, it's tuff and the content is aimed at the children's needs. Easy to use, loves the green case and durable. Free Time is for only 1 Year.\n",
